        <h1">Story of Self</h1>
        <p>\tReflecting on my junior year of high school, I would say that I could be described as somewhat 
        complacent and laid back. I completed assignments to a minimal extent when teachers gave them. 
        However, it was contradictory how I tried to insert quality and effort in my work. I knew I was a 
        slow worker and not proficient at multitasking, so I would designate a period of time to focus purely 
        on the assignment at hand. At the same time, I liked the Java problems that the students were given to 
        solve for computer science. Through the teacher’s lessons and assistance from classmates, the problems 
        could be completed within the time limit. While I did not code outside of class assignments, I kept 
        academic integrity by taking the time to understand why the program worked or did not work even with the 
        use of outside resources. As of recently, I enjoy slowly going through the content on freeCodeCamp. I plan 
        on finishing the courses throughout my senior year. I admit to not putting in as much effort as I should 
        have in junior year, so I intend to study hard senior year while tackling one college-related task at a time.
        <br>\tThrough my computer science elective, I learned about the Youth Career Connections Program. It has 
        taught me that opportunities are often not presented directly to us but they can be found if we look for 
        them with direction. We can apply for multiple scholarships and multiple internships. It’s important to know 
        our individual strengths and how our views align with the place we’re applying for. Even if I fail to get 
        the job at a certain company, I could still apply to the same company again. When the time comes that I do 
        get the job, there are some first-day questions I should ask in order to accustom myself with my position. 
        My participation in this academy has helped demonstrate my initiative to reach out to attain my goals. It 
        has provided me the opportunity to gain insight through its various webinars which will help me make the 
        transition into adulthood.</p>
